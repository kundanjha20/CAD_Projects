Brief about project :

VCO
========

Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) provides a periodic signal where the frequency of the periodic signal is related to the level of an input voltage control signal supplied to the VCO. A voltage controlled oscillator is simply an oscillator having a frequency output that is proportional to an applied voltage.
