VCO
========

Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) provides a periodic signal where the frequency of the periodic signal is related to the level of an input voltage control signal supplied to the VCO. A voltage controlled oscillator is simply an oscillator having a frequency output that is proportional to an applied voltage.
Below is a CMOS Circuit for the VCO having 11 inverter stage, Configured as ring oscillator

Here , control voltage is varied from 500mV to 1V (X- axis), corresponding Frequencies are plotted on Y-axis. We can observer from 500mV to 750mV , we have linear dependence between frequency and applied control voltage.
